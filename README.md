## Getting Started

---

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment (Vercel)

This project is designed for easy deployment to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**

   - Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel and deploy as a Next.js app.
   - All static data is served from `/public/data/github-data/`.

2. **Manual Data Updates:**

   - To update dashboard data, run:
     ```bash
     npm run load
     ```
   - This executes `node data/load.js`, fetching fresh data from GitHub and writing new JSON files to `/public/data/github-data/`.
   - Commit and push the updated JSON files to your repository, then redeploy to Vercel.

3. **Data Freshness:**
   - The dashboard shows the last updated timestamp at the bottom of the chart page.
   - Data is not live; it updates whenever you run the loader script and redeploy.

---

## ðŸ”„ Planned: Automated Data Updates with GitHub Actions

In the future, you can automate data refreshes by setting up a GitHub Actions workflow to:

- Run `npm run load` on a schedule (e.g., daily).
- Commit and push the updated data files.
- Trigger a Vercel redeploy (using a deploy hook or by pushing to main).

For now, all updates are manual to ensure you stay within GitHub API rate limits and have full control over data refreshes.

---

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x or higher
- npm
- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with repo access; create a `.env` file in project root containing:
  ```bash
  GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thisyearnofear/POS-dashboard.git
cd POS-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

3. Run the development server:

## Roadmap for Multi-Repo Dashboard

1. **Define your repos**
   - Create `repos.json` in the project root listing each project with `slug`, `owner`, `repo`, and `season`.
2. **Fetch all data**
   - Update `data/load.js` to read `repos.json`, loop over each entry, fetch GitHub issues, PRs, releases (with pagination), and save to `data/github-data/{slug}-issues.json`, `*-prs.json`, `*-releases.json`.
3. **Context provider**
   - Modify `src/providers/Github/Github.js` to import every `
